Then determine the p-value: The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the statistic computed from the sample, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
        "Finally make a Decision. If the p-value is less than or equal to alpha, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, and the result is considered statistically significant. If the p-value is greater than alpha, you fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the observed insight might have arisen by random chance.\n"

        "The Central Limit Theorem states that, given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates (samples) of independent random variables, each with a well-defined (but possibly different) expected value and a well-defined (but possibly different) variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution of the random variable.\n",
